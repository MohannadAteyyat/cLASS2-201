                I'm a simple guy with simple thoughts I have a Bachelor's degree in Mining Engineering in addition to
                that I gain a 2 years experience in another field which is Safety field but the truth  is that I chose
                the wrong field twice  first in mining and scoundly in Safety so this time I am entering Software
                Development field with ASAC and Fellow Code Academy , I hope this will be my correct choice and make me
                capable of crate remarkable achievements.

                Salt is a hillside town near Amman, Jordan. Its significance as an Ottoman Empire trading hub is
                reflected in its Ottoman architecture. The early-20th-century Abu Jaber mansion, now the Historic Old
                Salt Museum, has Italian frescoed ceilings. An Ottoman mosque overlooks Hammam Street with its food
                market. The Archaeological Museum focuses on finds from the Chalcolithic era (4500–3300 B.C.) to the
                16th century.
